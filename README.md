### Background Story:
I started designing lens adapters in 2019 and have slowly built a small collection of lens mounts, body mounts, and assorted caps to use in my designs. I wanted to share them with you all so that if there's something I haven't designed yet, or you're not happy with something that's already out there you can design something yourself. 

The Nikon F and Canon EF body mounts were designed to be easily assembled with mainly 3d printed parts and a few machine screws. So instead of a spring lens detent pin, I used a simple jam lock to actuate and release the lens detent pin. It's worked well on the test prints. The best part is that if any of the parts break you don't need to find some obscure 1.5mm spring or buy a random assortment of 2mm brass rods to cut down. 

As usual they are available in STL and STEP. I don't know why they're available in STL because they'll probably do you no good without something to put it on, but they are so do with them what you will.
